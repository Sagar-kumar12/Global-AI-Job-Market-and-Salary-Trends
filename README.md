Global AI Job Market and Salary Trends
This project analyzes a dataset of global Artificial Intelligence (AI) job postings to uncover key market and salary trends. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn), the analysis explores:

Top-paying industries in AI based on average salaries (USD)

Remote work trends segmented by experience level

Salary distributions across different company sizes

Most in-demand AI skills extracted from job postings

Education requirements vs salary levels

Monthly hiring trends for AI roles over time

Company-level hiring patterns

Additionally, the project uses clustering and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to identify patterns in job attributes.
